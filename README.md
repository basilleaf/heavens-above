## Scraping heavens-above.com for ISS passes
  
Python mechanize
  
I wanted to write a Python script that would scrape Heavens-above.com and post ISS pass details to the Chennai Astronomy Club on Facebook. I did a Google search and found something similar written by Dr Drang. However, the heavens-above site had been modified and the code was not working with the current version. So, I decided to modify the code to fit the current site.

To make it more interesting, I added some weather details fetcher to the code.
